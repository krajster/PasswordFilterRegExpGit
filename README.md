special thank's Yevgeny Menaker http://www.devx.com/security/Article/21522

Requirements:
               Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (https://goo.gl/tfO8xB)

Install and register a Windows password filter DLL:
Copy the DLL to the Windows installation directory on the domain controller or local computer. On standard 
installations, the default folder is \Windows\System32. Make sure that you create a 32-bit password filter DLL
for 32-bit computers and a 64-bit password filter DLL for 64-bit computers, and then copy them to the appropriate location.
